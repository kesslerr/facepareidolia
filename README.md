# face pareidolia
Using computer vision to disentangle face paredolia.

A short presentation of some first results is provided [here](https://github.com/kesslerr/facepareidolia/blob/master/presentation/FacePareidoliaPresentation.pdf).

A short article describing the main experiments and the results is given here [here](https://github.com/kesslerr/facepareidolia/blob/master/paper/Kessler2020pareidolia.pdf).

## stimuli

The stimuli are from 10 different subjects (S00-S10) which were measured in an MRI scanner, and two subject (B01-B02), which were measured just behaviorally. Subjects B01 and B02 have a lot more images labelled.

## labels

The label files for each subjects contains the image name, and the corresponding label ("face", or "noFace"). None of the images contained faces. But the subjects were told, that 50% of them did. So they labeled some image as "face" and some not.
